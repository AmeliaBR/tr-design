Welcome to the /TR redesign project!

This repository contains the style sheets used by W3C Technical Reports (http://www.w3.org/TR/), various logos, as well as sample technical reports.

The driving principles for this project are as follows:

1. W3C MUST NOT change the design of documents published in the past.
2. W3C MAY adopt a new /TR design only once per year, on January 1st.

Welcome to the /TR redesign project!

# Welcome to the /TR redesign project!

## Engagement Rules

For the purpose of this project, we have two high-level rules to guarantee ourselves to be efficient and creative:

1. **W3C MUST NOT change the design of documents published in the past.**
2. **W3C MAY adopt a new /TR design only once per year, on January 1st.**

### Consequences and considerations

1. There are no backward compatibility issues since we never change the design of documents already published and the new design MAY NOT accommodate the large set of documents published in the past by W3C.
2. A New design MUST accommodate the set of documents published within a given year.
3. Unique design among all W3C /TR documents is no longer guaranteed. Two W3C Recommendations published in two different years MAY look completely different. While consistency from year to year is NOT required, it should be kept in mind and balanced.
4. A new design does NOT have to address all possible future refinements before being adopted, such as taking into account all possible future user preferences and how to display all future combinations of those.
5. Proposed Recommendations published after the 15th of October should easily allow the W3C Advisory Committee to visualize the document using the new design of the following year. Note however that the new design may be tweaked until December 1st or rejected by the Director.

## Guidelines for a proper /TR design

1. Ensure the security and privacy of the individuals reading the document;
2. Ensure proper access by everyone regardless of disability;
3. Consider the different languages, scripts, and cultures from around the world;
4. Ensure that individuals can read properly the normative and non-normative parts of a specification when scripting is disabled or not available;
5. Consider the impact of the design on the W3C publication ecosystem: publication tools, authoring tools, editors
6. Ensure that the W3C Brand and general W3C website integration are respected, per the W3C Communications Team;
7. Consider the Web user agent compatibility risks (past, present, and future) and the long term maintenance

## Contributing

If you're familiar with GitHub then contributing is simple: just fork and make pull requests.

Discussions happen through issues, pull requests, and on spec-prod@w3.org.

## W3C Process for producing a new /TR design

For any given year:

1. No general proposals for a new design can be made after September 30.
2. No final design can be proposed after October 31. This is intended to ensure a minimum of one month for wide review of the final design before formal adoption.
3. The deadline to obtain Director approval for a final design is November 30. As a consequence, no substantive changes can be made to a final design after that date. This is intended to guarantee a minimum of one month advanced notice for the W3C publication ecosystem (publication tools, authoring tools, editors).
4. The new design becomes effective on January 1st of the following year and stops being operative after December 31st of the following year.

One _Design Point Person_ will be in charge of managing general proposals, proposing the final design, ensure [wide reviews](http://www.w3.org/2014/Process-20140801/#wide-review), address comments, and obtain Director approval for adoption. This person should engage with the W3C Community at large. The dates above are deadlines but the earlier the better, especially when considering the schedule of the W3C TPAC meeting.

The W3C webmaster will deploy the new style sheets and associated assets no later than December 1st, if approved by the Director.

If W3C cannot adopt a new design within a given year, the style of the current year remains effective for the following year.
